# 08. Unforgeable fingerprints

Phew, now we are just getting started trying to grok basic cryptography.
In the previous excercise we made sure that our banking application can verify if there has been any corruption of it's transaction log using hashing.

However, security wise, there are still some major flaws present. An attacker can simply modify some values in the transaction log and then re-generate another valid hash chain. Then the bank will never know it has been attacked! Let's try to fix this.
