# 10. Updating the threat model

By now our bank is actually pretty secure when looking at our original threat model.
The transaction log is signed and contains integrity checks, meaning you have to access to a well guarded secret key in order to modify the banks state.

Let's update our threat model with another requirement.

In this age of data leaks, we want to make sure that if an agent from a big government spy agency breaks into our bank server and steals the transaction log, as little data is leaked as possible about how much money the bank is storing etc.

To support this, let's introduce a new cryptographic primitive, symmetric encryption.

Symmetric encryption is a scheme where if you have another secret key (unrelated to the signing secret key from before) and a random nonce (a short single used key), you can encrypt a message securely.

You don't even need to keep the nonce secret, only the secret key.

Using `sodium-native` this functionality is exposed through the `crypto_secretbox` APIs

* `sodium.crypto_secretbox_easy(cipher, message, nonce, secretKey)`
* `var valid = sodium.crypto_secretbox_open_easy(message, cipher, nonce, secretKey)`

The `crypto_secretbox_easy` api will encrypt a message buffer into the cipher buffer using the nonce and secretKey. The `secretKey` should be a `sodium.crypto_secretbox_KEYBYTES` bytes long buffer containing very random data. You can generate a secure one using the `sodium.randombytes_buf` API. `cipher` is the buffer where the encrypted message is saved. This buffer should be `message.length + crypto_secretbox_MACBYTES` long, and finally `nonce` should be another random buffer of size `crypto_secretbox_NONCEBYTES`. It is important that you never re-use a nonce to encrypt more than a single message.

## Problem

Use the APIs described above to make three new programs, `secret-key.js` `encrypt.js` and `decrypt.js`.

* `secret-key.js` should generate a secret key using the randombytes_buf api of the correct length
* `encrypt.js` should accept a secret key and a message and print out the encrypted message and the random nonce used to encrypt it.
* `decrypt.js` should accept the encrypted message, secret key and nonce and print out the plaintext message if valid.

## Testing

Try running a couple of test messages like `Hello, World` through your encrypter and try decrypting them to see that it works. Then try tampering with some of the encrypted messages to see that decryption fails.
