# 06. Our first crypto primitive (hashing)

Now that we have a running bank and a threat model with a high risk target,
let's look at what we can do to mitigate this risk. As mentioned previously,
in this workshop we will be using the cryptographic library called `libsodium`,
exposed to Javascript by the `sodium-native` module. This suite of primitives
has a strong focus on being user friendly, hard to misuse and being "high level".
Many of the primitives we will be looking at here also have equivalents in the
core `crypto` module, which is based on OpenSSL.

## Side quest

`sodium-native` is a native module, which in itself can be a side quest to
install. However we, @mafintosh and @emilbayes, try hard to provide prebuilt
binaries for all major platforms and releases of node and electron. This means
you shouldn't have to compile anything when installing the module.

```sh
npm install sodium-native
```

## Buffers

One of the fundamental building blocks that make cryptography practical and
safe (and fun!) in Javascript is the core `Buffer` prototype. `Buffer`s today
are the same as `Uint8Arrays` with some extra methods to make working with them
easier. `Buffer`s in node is the closest you get to raw memory access, but in a
safe manner, so you don't have overflow bugs, like in C/C++. Below are some of
the most important `Buffer` methods that you will be using in the workshop,
namely allocating a specific number of bytes and converting the Buffer back to
something that is a proper string:

```js
// Creating buffers
Buffer.alloc(32) // Allocate empty 32 byte Buffer
Buffer.from('Hello world') // Allocate buffer and write 'Hello world'
Buffer.alloc(32).fill('Hello') // Allocate 32 byte Buffer and repeat 'Hello'

// Converting to printable strings
buf.toString('hex') // Octets in as hexadecimal
buf.toString('base64') // Octets as ascii safe string (base64)
```

## Another side quest

Try spinning up a node repl and play around with the `Buffer` commands listed above.
For example, try generating a 13 byte `Buffer` and write `Hello, world!` to it.

## Problem

Write a new program, `hash-example.js`. Using `sodium-native` try hashing the string "Hello, World!" using the `sodium.crypto_generichash` primitive and print out the result as a hex string.

## Testing

Running your program it should produce the output `511bc81dde11180838c562c82bb35f3223f46061ebde4a955c27b3f489cf1e03`.


TODO: move this to solutions
```js
var sodium = require('sodium-native')
// Allocate Buffer for output hash
var output = Buffer.alloc(sodium.crypto_generichash_BYTES)
// Convert input string to Buffer
var input = Buffer.from('Hello, World!')

// Compute blake2b hash
sodium.crypto_generichash(output, input)

// Convert bytes to printable string
console.log(output.toString('hex'))
```
