# 09. Signing the transaction log

Now that we have a basic understanding on how digital signatures work we can start securing the transaction log with this new primitive.

Remember, since we already have a hash-chain of all transactions the only thing missing is making sure we, the bank, are the only ones that are generating the hash-chain.

## Problem

Using the signature APIs you learned about in the previous excercise, extend the bank to:

1. Check if a previous keypair is stored on disk, if so load it.
1. If not, generate a new keypair and store it.
1. When you generate a new hash for a transaction, sign it using the secret key and store the signature as a new property `signature`, next to the `hash` and `value` property.
1. When loading the transaction log remember to verify the last signature to see if the log has been tampered with.

Note that in a real life application, we ofcourse wouldn't store the keypair on disk but instead on an external device like a usb stick or a hardware backed secure vault.

## Testing

Make sure your bank works the same way as before. Then stop the bank and try tampering with the log. The bank should reject the bad transaction log, even is the hashes are correct.
