# Extra credit

Whoa, so you finished the entire workshop! Good job.
What you can do now is ask @mafintosh or @emilbayes about ways to secure your bank even more.

For example

* Make sure communication between the teller and bank is always encrypted to ensure privacy
* Use key derivation so only have a single secret key that is used generate encryption and signing keys

Good luck!
