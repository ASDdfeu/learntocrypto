# 08. Unforgeable fingerprints

Phew, now we are just getting started trying to grok basic cryptography.
In the previous excercise we made sure that our banking application can verify if there has been any corruption of it's transaction log using hashing.

However, security wise, there are still some major flaws present. An attacker can simply modify some values in the transaction log and then re-generate another valid hash chain. Then the bank will never know it has been attacked! Let's try to fix this.

Basically we need a way for the bank to verify that it was the one that wrote the hashes of the transaction log in the first place. That way an attacker couldn't simply rewrite the transaction with another hash-chain.

In cryptography this is called a digital signature. A digital signature is a cryptographic primitive that has two method, `sign` and `verify`. `sign` takes a secret key that the signer guards very carefully, and a message to sign. It returns a digital signature. Using a verify API third parties (or the signer) can verify that a message hasn't been forged by passing in the message, the digital signature and the corresponding public key of the secret key used to sign it.

Using sodium the digital signature api is exposed as

* `sodium.crypto_sign_keypair(publicKey, secretKey)`
* `sodium.crypto_sign_detached(signature, message, secretKey)`
* `var bool = sodium.crypto_sign_verify_detached(signature, message, publicKey)`

The `crypto_sign_keypair` api will generate a public and secret key into the buffers you pass to it.
The `publicKey` buffer should be `sodium.crypto_sign_PUBLICKEYBYTES` bytes long and the secret key `sodium.crypto_sign_SECRETKEYBYTES` bytes.

`crypto_sign_detached` will sign a message and but the result in the signature buffer which should be `crypto_sign_BYTES` bytes, and finally `crypto_sign_verify_detached` will verify a given signature and return a bool wheather it was valid or not.

This primitive will allow us to upgrade our bank's transaction log with an unforgeable fingerprint (or signature) so we can verify that only the bank is updating it.

First let's do a basic excercise to get a bit more familiar with the API

## Problem

Use the sodium signature api to make two new programs `sign.js` and `verify.js`.
`sign.js` should generate a keypair, sign a message from the command line and print out
the message, public key and signature. `verify.js` should accept the public key, message and signature and verify that it is correct.

## Testing

Try generating a few messages and keys and verify them. Then try tampering with the signature and messages
and verify that the verify script rejects them.

For extra credit try sending your signed messages to other people in the workshop and have them verify it
