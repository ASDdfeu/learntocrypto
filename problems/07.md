# 07. Ensuring the integrity of the transaction log

Using a hash we can start making our transaction much more secure in correspondance to the threat model we establised in our earlier excersise. Remember the goal is to make sure that it is hard for an adversory to start forging the log.

A first step in doing this is adding integrity checks to the log. We can use the hashing primitive we learned about in the previous excersise to hash entry entry of the log to make it easier to detect when forgery happen. An easy way to hash a log item is to `JSON.stringify` and use your solution from before.

```js
function appendToTransactionLog (item) {
  log.push({
    value: item,
    hash: hashToHex(JSON.stringify(item))
  })
}
```

However hashing each entry doesn't give us that strong a security guarantee. The only thing we gain from this is being able to check if an individual log item has been tampered with (assuming we know the hash). We could get around this by hashing the entire transaction log everytime we push to it, however this quickly becomes inefficient and can have other security implications out of scope right now.

If items in the transaction log is re-ordered all the hashes still remain the same, although this can be catastrophic for the bank! To get around this we can use something called a hash chain. A hash chain is list where each item has a hash of that data stored in that item AND the previous hash. This makes sure you cannot re-order the structure and that it is easy to produce.

```js
var genesisHash = Buffer.alloc(32).toString('hex')
function appendToTransactionLog (item) {
  var prevHash = log.length ? log[log.length - 1].hash : genesisHash
  log.push({
    value: item,
    hash: hashToHex(prevHash + JSON.stringify(item))
  })
}
```

## Problem

Convert the transaction log into a hash chain and verify the integrity when you start the bank.

## Testing

Test that the commands we defined earlier still work as expected. Then try modifying the transaction log by hand and restart the bank appliction. When restarted the bank should detect that the transaction log has been tampered with.
